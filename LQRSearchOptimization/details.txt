LQR Optimization:

LQR searched over a space of controllers varying the ratio of Q to R from 10^-2 to 10^2. 
Then the bike was tested with an initial lean angle of pi/6 and the controller
	with the lowest balance score was choosen, 

The balance score was calculated as square of the sum of the lean, lean rate, 
	steer angles (tested for 8 seconds with 1/50 timestep).

LQR Best: gains of [11.1,2.4,-6.6] were selected
	balance score of 5.166 
	15.55*Q : R
	e1 = -5.39
	e2 = -2.91 + 2.0i
	e3 = -2.91 - 2.0i

Control gains of [71, 21, -20] yeilded a score of 5.146. 
	(basically the same as LQR!!!)
Grid Search optimized gains of [23,16,-2] yeilded a score of 4.9358


MAX STEER ANGLE:
The LQR gains were able to recover from an initial lean angle of 0.77!! (only slightly less than
than pi/4 =0.785 - the fail clause). The grid search based controller could not recover from this angle!
The control gains recover from a max initial lean angle of 0.74.
