Tests with desired steer:

4 balance controllers were tested to achieve a desired steer angle.
desired steer was a sine wave with a period of 8 seconds and a max amplitude = 0.52 rad

ICs: phi0 = phidot0 = delta0 = 0

Nav_Score = sqrt of sum of squares of difference between delta and delta commanded

Controller:	Gains:			Score:		
LQR 		[11.1,2.4,-6.6]		3.88	
Grid Search  	[23,16,-2]		3.84
Nav (control)	[71, 21, -20]		3.04
Old (control)	[71,10,-20]		2.11
